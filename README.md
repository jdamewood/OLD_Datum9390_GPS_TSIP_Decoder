# OLD_Datum9390_GPS_TSIP_Decoder
This program is a Python3 non-standard TSIP parser for serial RS-232 binaries captured from old (1990's) Datum9390-55165 Trimble GPS receiver.
Created this program because receiver does not fully work with Trimble TSIP Rev C and to practice writing binary parsing.

The run the program, use the console command: 'python3 tsipdecode.py tsip7.bin'.
The other program datumserial.py reads directly from the serial port. Currently is it set up for 19200 baud with HW hand handshaking. 
The run this use 'python3 datumserial.py'. 


Enjoy,
