# OLD_Datum9390_GPS_TSIP_Decoder
This program is a Python3 non-standard TSIP parser for serial RS-232 binaries captured from old (1990's) Datum9390-55165 Trimble GPS receiver.
Created this program because receiver does not fully work with Trimble TSIP Rev C and to practice writing binary parsing.

The run the program, use the console command: 'python3 tsipdecode.py tsip3.bin'.

Enjoy,

James
